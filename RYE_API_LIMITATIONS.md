# Rye.com API Limitations and Workarounds

## Current API Limitations Discovered

### ❌ What Rye.com API CANNOT Do
1. **No Keyword-Based Search**: The API does not support searching products by keywords like "wireless headphones" or "gaming laptop"
2. **No Browse Categories**: Cannot browse product categories or get product lists by category
3. **Requires Specific Product IDs**: Only works with exact product IDs (ASINs for Amazon, product IDs for Shopify)
4. **Domain-Based Queries Only**: Can only retrieve products from specific domains if you already know the URL

### ✅ What Rye.com API CAN Do
1. **Product Details by ID**: Retrieve full product information if you have the exact product ID
2. **Batch Product Retrieval**: Get up to 25 products at once by their IDs
3. **Real-Time Pricing**: Current prices and availability status
4. **Multi-Marketplace**: Support for Amazon, Shopify, and other platforms
5. **Product Images**: Access to product image URLs
6. **Specifications**: Detailed product specifications and features

## Impact on FireKyt Features

### Current Workaround Strategy
Since users expect to search by keywords (natural behavior), we've implemented:

1. **Enhanced Simulation**: Realistic product data that demonstrates the scoring system
2. **Clear API Status**: Users understand this is a demonstration of the scoring capability
3. **Future Integration Path**: Ready to integrate real Rye data when product IDs are available

### How Rye Could Be Used Effectively
1. **Content Enhancement**: Once you have Amazon ASINs from other sources, use Rye to get real-time pricing and specs
2. **Competitor Analysis**: Track specific products you're already familiar with
3. **Price Monitoring**: Monitor known products for price changes
4. **Product Validation**: Verify product information for content creation

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Current Status
- **GraphQL Queries**: Working but limited to ID-based lookups
- **Authentication**: Valid API key and proper authentication
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for various failure modes
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects Rye's API limits and batch constraints

### Next Steps for Real Integration
1. **Product ID Discovery**: Implement alternative methods to find product IDs
2. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine Rye with other data sources for keyword discovery
3. **Manual Product Addition**: Allow users to add specific products by URL/ID
4. **Curated Product Lists**: Maintain lists of popular products with known IDs
